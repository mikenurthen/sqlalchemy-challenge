Module 10 Homework - SQLAlchemy Challenge

This is my repository for the submission of the Module 10 Homework. To submit this homework, I reviewed the class activities for Week 10, made use of ChatGPT and Expert Learning Assistant in asking questions related to my code, and worked with classmate Kiet Hoang on how to approach the writing of my Python file.
